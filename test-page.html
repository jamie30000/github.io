What is car insurance?
So what exactly is car insurance?

Well, to put it simply, car insurance is a type of coverage that can provide protection for your car against a wide range of risks, beyond just damage.

With comprehensive car cover, you can rest easy knowing that you're covered for things like theft, vandalism, fire, natural disasters, and more. So, if a tree falls on your car during a storm or someone dinks your bumper pulling out of a parking spot, you're covered.

Why do I need car insurance?
Essentially, having car insurance cover is all about securing peace of mind. Accidents can happen at any time, and having a policy can help protect you financially in case of an accident, theft, or another unexpected event.

Not only does car cover provide financial protection, it’s also a legal requirement. Driving without insurance can result in hefty fines or even legal trouble. But, with the right coverage, you can feel confident that you're protected no matter what the road throws your way.

What type of car insurance do I need?
The type of car insurance you will need depends on the level of cover you’re after. For instance, if you're looking for the bare minimum, third party insurance might be the way to go, whereas if you want to be fully protected, you’ll need a more comprehensive insurance package. Below are the different types of insurance we offer:

Fully comprehensive
Offers the highest level of protection, designed to keep you as financially unaffected as possible in the event of an accident. Comprehensive car protection will cover you for the following:

Injuries you, passengers, and other drivers suffer from
Accidental damage
Damage to a third-parties' car or property
Vandalism or theft (including attempted theft)
Fire damage
Dents, scratches and chips
Third party, fire and theft
If your car is stolen or damaged in a fire, you’ll be protected under this cover. A third party’s injuries and vehicle damage with also be covered, but damage to your own car will not.

Third party only
This is the lowest level of car cover, required as a bare minimum to drive on UK roads. Third Party only protects you if other people are injured or their property is damaged.

It is important to know that the exact details of each of these levels of cover differs for each insurer, meaning the cover you’re looking for may depend on the provider you choose.

Optional upgrades and enhancements
Your vehicle insurance does not need to come as standard, as insurers will often offer you optional extras you can add to your policy. The most common additional cover options include:

Breakdown cover
Courtesy car cover
Windscreen cover
Wrong fuel cover
Cover for lost or stolen keys
No claims discount protection
Personal injury cover
Each insurance provider is different – some will charge you to add upgrades to your policy, whilst others offer them free of charge. It’s important that you find out exactly what an insurer does or doesn’t offer before taking out a policy, so you can make sure you can protect yourself however you deem fit.

What isn’t covered?
Each insurance provider is different, so being aware of exactly what isn’t included in your policy is crucial to ensure you don’t feel unexpectedly out of pocket.

Typically, fully comprehensive car insurance policies will not cover you for:

Driving with an invalid driving license.
Any damage or injuries caused as a result of the driver being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Theft resulting from carelessness.
Any general wear or tear.
Speaking to an insurance broker though can help you with comparing your policy options, as they can source you all the options that meet your criteria and provide you with adequate cover.

How to get cheaper car insurance
Who doesn’t want to know how they can get a cheaper car insurance quote? The good news is, there are ways you can reduce your car insurance premiums, and they are as follows...

Shop around and compare
It is worthwhile weighing up your options and comparing what different insurers have to offer. An easy way to do this is to speak to a car insurance broker, who will take your details and source you deals based on your information.

Reduce your annual mileage
The further you drive your car each year, the more likely you are to make a claim, in the eyes of an insurer. So, if you can afford to drive a little less each year, it could reduce your insurance premium.

Keep your driving record clean
Insurance companies often offer lower rates to drivers with a clean driving record, so it's important to drive safely and avoid accidents and traffic violations.

Stay safe and secure
Driving a car equipped with safety features such as anti-lock brakes, airbags, and anti-theft devices may qualify for lower insurance rates. Insurers will also bear in mind where you park your car overnight, as home driveways for example are deemed safer and more secure.

Avoid large engine cars
Looking for a new car? Cars with larger, more powerful engines typically cost more to insure.

We also remind our clients though that the cheapest option may not always be the best option. It's important to weigh the cost and benefits of different policies before choosing car insurance that’s right for you.

Is it cheaper to use a car insurance broker?
It doesn’t have to cost you more to get expert advice and guidance when you’re looking for car cover.

Differently to comparison sites, we offer a personalised, bespoke service which is tailored around getting to know you personally, whilst fully understanding what you’re looking for from a car policy. Moreover, our goal is also to get you our best value car insurance deals available on the market via our panel of insurers. We aim to save you time, money and hassle when comparing cover options.

What else can affect car insurance prices?
Yes, there are ways that you could potentially lower the overall cost of your car insurance premium. However, there are also aspects that can affect your premium price, which are out of your control. Your car insurance premium cost could be influenced by:

Your occupation – insurers deem some jobs riskier than others, influencing insurance premiums.

Your age – younger drivers will typically be charged more than older drivers.

Your car’s insurance group – you’ll pay less if your car is in a lower insurance group.

Where you live – the number of claims made in the area you live in will affect the cost of your premium.

Your driving experience – New drivers are deemed to present a higher risk to insurers, so the more driving experience you have, the better.

Additional drivers –a named driver on your policy could potentially lower a premium, especially if they are an experienced driver with a clean driving record.

What do I need to get a car insurance quote?
It's easy to get your hands on a car insurance quote. All you have to do is provide us with the following information:

Your personal details – your name, your age, where you live, your job title etc.
Information about your car – the registration number, its make and model, how old the car is.
How you’ll intend to use the car – will you be driving the car for pleasure or business? What is your annual mileage?
Your driving record – we’ll need your driving license number, how long you’ve been driving for, and whether you’ve made any claims in the past.

Choose Howden Life & Health for your unemployment cover
Losing your job, and therefore your income, can be horribly stressful. By taking out an unemployment insurance policy, you can have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that if you’re made redundant, you’ll have a financial safety net in place to help you meet your essential costs.

12 months benefit
A choice of excess periods
Carers cover available
What does unemployment insurance do?
Unemployment cover is designed to pay out up to 65% of your monthly income for up to 12 months, so you can keep paying your bills and housing costs while you look for new employment.

You can also choose to add ‘carers cover’ to your policy. This can help provide you with protection in case you’re forced out of work to care for your loved ones.

Our expert advisors can help you find the unemployment insurance policy that best suits your needs, and help you avoid paying more than you need to on your premium.

Why unemployment insurance?
16 million people reportedly have less than £100 in savings leaving, them no protection for 'a rainy day', but most of us need protection so that we can ensure that when we are out of work, we can still pay the bills.

Mortgages, rent, energy bills, running the car, insurances, council tax and of course food, all are basic expenses which will need to be paid regardless of if we are working or not. The financial implications of not being able to pay the rent or the mortgage could be severe.

Unemployment insurance can help make sure you’re able to pay these essential bills if the worst happens.

Who's taking care of your people risks?
Running your own business can be extremely rewarding but occasionally you might hit a bump in the road. What would happen if you, or another key person in your business became seriously ill? Would it affect sales or productivity? Could you afford to recruit and train another senior member of staff and how would that impact upon workload, customers and staff morale?

<div>Choose Howden Life & Health for your Income Protection
Income protection is designed to replace or supplement your income in the event that you are unable to work. Insurance can be taken out to cover accidents, sickness and is intended to provide short term cover ranging from 12 to 24 months or up until retirement on long term accident & sickness cover, depending on the policy.

Common reasons for taking out income protection include protecting mortgage or loan payments whilst ensuring you are able to maintain your lifestyle and can continue to financially support your family and loved ones.

An introduction to Income Protection. What are the different types of income protection?
There are two types of income protection available to people: Accident, sickness and unemployment insurance and long term income protection. Both look to pay you a regular income until either you go back to work, or the policy term ends.

Accident, Sickness and Unemployment Insurance
Other words that are used to describe this type of policy include mortgage payment insurance, payment protection insurance and short term-income protection. This type of policy is usually brought to cover something specific e.g. a mortgage.

Long Term Income Protection
Long term income protection will provide you with a steady and regular income until you are fit for work, or until the policy term ends. When thinking about income protection (IP) it's always best to get advice and understand the options available to you.

Long term or short term?
When deciding and comparing income protection cover, you’ll need to choose between long term income protection and short term income insurance</div>
<div>What is health insurance?
Health insurance is designed to cover the cost of private medical treatment. It will normally cover you for ‘acute conditions’, such as a hip replacement or having a hernia removed.

You can purchase different types of policies that offer different levels of cover, at different costs. This could include fast-track diagnostics for cancer or access to different cancer treatments not currently available on the NHS.

The benefits of health insurance
By having private healthcare, you could be seen and treated faster. You could have treatments or drugs that the NHS are unable to fund. You could also be treated in a private hospital with your own room. Plus, you are free to choose your doctor and hospital, within the limits of your policy.

Types of private medical insurance
There is a lot of different types of health insurance available to choose from, they include:

Individual health insurance - Allows you to bypass NHS waiting times and receive treatment quickly If you become ill or injured.
Family health insurance - Gives cover for any family members including your policy, making sure that treatment is received quickly should you require it.
Child health insurance - Provides cover for your children giving peace of mind that their health care is protected.
Joint health insurance - Offers health insurance for you and your partner, so you are assured treatment will be received promptly and at a choice of hospitals.
Health Insurance is there to cover non-routine tests and treatment
Each policy is different, but they do have some common procedures that will be included:

Surgery as an inpatient or day patient
Tests and scans
Hospital accommodation and nursing care
Consultations
Therapy
Diagnostics of chronic conditions
Exclusive drugs
Health insurance is designed to treat you for acute conditions that start after your policy has begun, it however it is not to cover every health condition. Many chronic and pre-existing conditions (e.g., arthritis or asthma) are excluded as standard. As well as the following:

Dental services (unless added to your plan)
Organ transplant, Prescription drugs and dressings, after leaving the hospital or as an outpatient

<div>Choose Howden Life & Health for your Income Protection
Income protection is designed to replace or supplement your income in the event that you are unable to work. Insurance can be taken out to cover accidents, sickness and is intended to provide short term cover ranging from 12 to 24 months or up until retirement on long term accident & sickness cover, depending on the policy.

Common reasons for taking out income protection include protecting mortgage or loan payments whilst ensuring you are able to maintain your lifestyle and can continue to financially support your family and loved ones.

An introduction to Income Protection. What are the different types of income protection?
There are two types of income protection available to people: Accident, sickness and unemployment insurance and long term income protection. Both look to pay you a regular income until either you go back to work, or the policy term ends.

Accident, Sickness and Unemployment Insurance
Other words that are used to describe this type of policy include mortgage payment insurance, payment protection insurance and short term-income protection. This type of policy is usually brought to cover something specific e.g. a mortgage.

Long Term Income Protection
Long term income protection will provide you with a steady and regular income until you are fit for work, or until the policy term ends. When thinking about income protection (IP) it's always best to get advice and understand the options available to you.

Long term or short term?

<p>To point a full domain to a basic HTML page in the quietest (i.e., simplest) way possible, you can follow these steps:

Choose a Hosting Service: You can host your HTML page on a variety of platforms. For basic HTML hosting, you can use:

GitHub Pages (free)
Netlify (free tier available)
Vercel (free tier available)
Traditional Web Hosting (e.g., Bluehost, HostGator, or similar)
Prepare Your HTML File: Make sure you have your index.html file (and any associated files, like CSS or images) ready.

Upload Your HTML to Hosting Platform:

For GitHub Pages, you can create a repository, upload your files, and enable GitHub Pages in the settings.
For Netlify or Vercel, simply drag and drop your index.html into their deployment interface.
For traditional hosting, upload your files via FTP or the file manager provided by your host.
Configure Your Domain: Once your HTML page is hosted, you need to point your domain to the hosting server by configuring DNS records:

For GitHub Pages:
You’ll need to create a CNAME record in your domain's DNS settings pointing to username.github.io.
For Netlify or Vercel:
They will provide you with DNS records that you need to configure on your domain provider's DNS management page.
For Traditional Hosting:
You would generally update your domain's A or CNAME records to point to the IP address or URL of your hosting provider.
Test: After setting up your DNS and uploading your files, wait for DNS propagation (it can take a few minutes to a few hours), and then test by typing your domain in the browser.

This approach is simple, quiet, and cost-effective for getting a basic HTML page live under your domain.

can GitHub Pages do a fqd
ChatGPT said:
Yes, GitHub Pages can work with a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), meaning you can point a custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com) to your GitHub Pages site.

Here’s how you can set it up:
<a href="/test-page.html">test page</a>

<a href="/50s-test.html">50s page</a>
  
1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository
Create a repository named username.github.io where username is your GitHub username.
Upload your basic HTML files (including index.html) into this repository.
2. Create a CNAME File in Your Repository
In the root of your repository (where index.html is), create a file named CNAME.
Inside the CNAME file, write your custom domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).
Commit and push this file to your repository.
3. Configure Your Domain DNS
Log into your domain registrar's control panel (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).
You need to create a CNAME record pointing to username.github.io. This is typically the most common setup for pointing to GitHub Pages.
For root domain (yourdomain.com): You’ll need to add an A record with the following GitHub Pages IP addresses:
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
For subdomain (www.yourdomain.com): Add a CNAME record pointing to username.github.io.
4. Enable Custom Domain in GitHub Pages Settings
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to Settings > Pages.
In the "Custom domain" section, enter your domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).
Save the changes.
5. Wait for DNS Propagation
After making these changes, it may take some time (anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours) for DNS changes to propagate fully.
6. Test Your Site
Once DNS changes have propagated, go to your domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com), and it should show the HTML page hosted on GitHub Pages.
Notes:
GitHub Pages supports custom domains for both root domains (yourdomain.com) and subdomains (www.yourdomain.com).
If you use a subdomain (like www), it's usually easier because you just need to set up the CNAME record.
GitHub will automatically enforce HTTPS on custom domains with a valid SSL certificate, so your site will be served over HTTPS once everything is set up.
This way, you can point a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to your GitHub Pages site with ease!</p>

<div>"Signposting health and protection products to your clients where appropriate is essential to ensuring your client has suitable insurance needs. Perhaps your client has complex medical needs, or a family history of conditions or is simply looking for private medical treatments in certain hospitals but you don’t know the answers. This is when you need to signpost your clients to advisors who do know the answers. Don’t avoid the subject as it’s something you don’t understand or maybe you don’t have the tools to sell. Talk to your clients openly and let them know there are experts who can help.

Signposting has been a term used in the industry for many years, but more recently over the last year and even more important since the pandemic. Consumers need the right advice and right products and often one person isn’t able to advise on everything and the best option is to refer to another expert.

When pointing the client in the right direction not only are you doing the right thing for them, but also the industry. We have a simple and impressive commission structure for referrals, which you can see details of on the submit a client form."</div>
